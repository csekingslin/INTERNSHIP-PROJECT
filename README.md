# Caesar Cipher Encryption Frontend Web Page

This project is a **Frontend Web Page** that implements the **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique, developed by **Kingslin** for **Dr. G U Pope College of Engineering**. The web page allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher method, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encrypt Text**: Input a message and select a shift value to encrypt it using Caesar Cipher.
- **Decrypt Text**: Decrypt an encrypted message using the same shift value.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface to input and display results.
- **Shift Value Input**: Allows users to select the shift value for the encryption or decryption process.
